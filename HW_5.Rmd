#### **In 2026, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration in Independence, commemorating a hallmark birthday.**

[PHILADELPHIA250](https://www.philadelphia250.us/) is the organization
tasked with the orchestration, promotion, and execution of city-wide
events related to the 250th - right where many of the historic events
took place. Danielle DiLeo Kim, as the organization's president and
overseer of its projects and initiatives, is tasked with not only
orchestrating anniversary-related events during the year, but also
creating lasting partnerships throughout the city that will keep the
momentum of the mega-event burning for years to come. Working directly
with DiLeo Kim, I have spent the last few months constructing one
pathway towards making the 250th an inclusive, neighborhood-based
commemoration.

**This report offers one approach to creating an empirical look into the
Philadelphia neighborhoods, ending with a recommendation of selected
"gateways" and other considerations for further development.**

# **Celebrate, locally!**

> **One of the challenges Danielle and the PHL250 team has chosen to
> take on is the implementation of 250th events on the neighborhood
> scale.**

Over the last three centuries, Philadelphia welcomed the many of the
budding nation's "firsts": its first hospital, bank, stock exchange,
theater, university, zoo, and electronic computer were all the work of
Philadelphians. These advancements in science, government, and the arts
brought the City international attention, designating it the Nation's
first UNESCO World Heritage City ([article
here](https://www.phl.org/at-phl/art-exhibitions/digital-art-exhibitions/node322)).

As the City welcomes thousands of visitors looking to engage in the
250th celebrations, it is crucial for PHILADELPHIA250 to assist in
introducing Philadelphia's complex identity on the national (and
international) stage. Recognizing corridors along areas of particular
historical, social, and cultural significance may act as "gateways" to
the city for neighboring areas and residents. Highlighting these areas
allows Philadelphians to celebrate their neighborhood in a way that is
unique to them, welcoming those wanting to learn more.

### What is a Gateway?

The Gateways represent locations around the City that will become
activated at different times throughout 2026, coordinating with local
events and festivities that happen around special times of the year.
Visitors navigating the gateway should be able to maneuver around the
neighborhood in a few hours, or a short day trip. Activities may include
walking tours, bus tours, museum trips, food tastings, and interactions
with favorite businesses and residents.

# **Methodology and Exploratory Analysis**

#### What information is available?

To look for areas around the city that may act as appropriate gateways,
we may first begin with an empirical analysis of publicly available
information and datasets, obtained through OpenDataPhilly.

-   [City Landmarks -
    OpenDataPhilly](https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/city-landmarks/)

-   [Philadelphia Neighborhoods -
    OpenDataPhilly](https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/philadelphia-neighborhoods/)

-   [US Census - Foreign Born
    Population](https://www.census.gov/topics/population/foreign-born.html)

-   Philadelphia Geographic features (location analysis, see below)

### Let's map!

After analyzing the available data, it becomes clear that we should
consider mapping analysis to highlight areas that have formally
identified cultural landmarks. This can be found using the City
Landmarks dataset.

**To create the landmarks map, I took the following actions to filter:**

1.  Download the landmark shp from ODP (OpenDataPhilly)

2.  Filter out:

    -   double entries
    -   Youth Centers
    -   Airports
    -   Animal Clinics
    -   Health Centers
    -   High Schools
    -   Hospitals
    -   Police Stations
    -   Shopping Centers
    -   Senior Care Facilities
    -   Water Pumping Stations
    -   School/University Campuses
    -   Transportation
    -   Swimming Pools
    -   Social Services
    -   Post Offices
    -   Parking Garages/Lots
    -   Judicial Buildings
    -   Golf Courses
    -   Garages
    -   Fire Stations
    -   Cemeteries
    -   Bridges
    -   Municipal Buildings
    -   Playgrounds
    -   Houses of Worship

## Identified Cultural Landmarks

After completing the data cleaning process detailed above, the following
cultural landmark map was created:

![](images/LandmarkPoints.jpg)

> **Existing identified cultural landmarks are largely centered around
> Germantown, Fairmount Park, and Center City.**

It becomes clear that the Germantown, Fairmount Park, and Center City
areas are hotspots of identified cultural landmarks. However, as any
Philly resident can tell you, this map clearly misses many key areas
around the city, particularly in South Philly and Northeast areas.

## Highlighting Immigrant Communities

Philly's South and Northeast pockets are known for being home to
international cultures. With a large amount of their residents being
born outside of the US, these areas may be key to helping to highlight
some of the City's cultural heritage. Using data pulled from the US
Census, the map below displays percentage of residents who are born
outside of the US, signaling areas of the City that have strong
immigrant populations. Here, the South and Northeast regions are
confirmed to hold characteristics not seen anywhere else the City,
making them excellent places to consider looking for Gateway corridors.

## Public Engagement

While these maps may be pretty, they can only show us a glimpse of the
story of Philly's residents and the streets they call home. As mentioned
before, no one knows the City better than those who have built their
lives there. For this next step in the process, we began to engage
community leaders and local organizations, asking them about where they
call home and how they identify their community.

The map was presented at the Sunset Social community engagement meeting
on November 1st. During the presentation, those in attendence were
invited to place a dot on the map signaling what areas they consider to
be their community. Understanding how organizations self identify allows
us to have a more localized vantage point for viewing the connections
among neighbors, as well as locate organizations and individuals that
may act as potential partners and stakeholders in the gateway selection
process.

## Recommended Gateway Areas

After reviewing the results of mapping officially recognized cultural
landmarks, immigrant communities, and Sunset Social engagement, a few
potential sites for gateway locations have been highlighted, shown on
the map below.

# **Conclusion**

![](images/conclusionPictures.JPG){width="759"}

#### What have we learned?

After completing this analysis, a few things become clear. First, there
are clear spatial patterns associated with the areas marked with
officially recognized cultural landmarks. These areas tend to be near
neighborhoods that draw large tourism numbers and feature attractions
known on the national, and often international, scale. However, it also
becomes clear that this cataloging largely leaves out deeply ingrained
communities around the city, particularly those with a strong immigrant
presence.

Moreover, there is a demonstrated effort from local organizations that
community leaders want to be deeply involved in the planning process for
the 250th. More direct and qualitative explorations must be considered,
discussed below, and are welcomed by community members. Many Philly
residents feel proud to have their neighborhood highlighted during the
mega-event, and are happy to propose ideas of how to involve visitors
and other Philadelphians.

## Further Considerations

Some assumptions that we made at the beginning of this analysis hold
true. It is not possible for two people to accurately assess the
important cultural landmarks around Philadelphia - that power lies in
those who know Philly best. In order to most accurately assess which
areas can (and should) serve as Gateways, on the ground research must be
done.

> **Mapping what we already know is not enough, we must tap into the
> established knowledge that Philly's community leaders know best.**

Starting in January, we will continue to define and redefine the areas
marked in the Gateway map seen above. We will walk along the boundaries
we draw, chatting with business-owners, neighbors, and visitors we meet
along the way. Mapping what we already know is not enough, we must tap
into the well-established knowledge that Philly's community leaders know
best.
